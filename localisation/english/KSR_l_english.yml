Tacna has been the original capital of the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation in 1836, and some may argue that a government which does not operate from Lima or La Paz eases the risk of one nation dominating the politics of the entire country.\n\nWhere will we set up the capital of Peru-Bolivia - Lima, La Paz or Tacna?"
